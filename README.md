# About

rcswitch-pi is for controlling rc remote controlled power sockets 
with the raspberry pi. Kudos to the projects [rc-switch](http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch)
and [wiringpi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi).



## Usage

receiver on pin 2 (see wiringpi)

transmitter on pin 0 (see wiringpi)

First you have to install the [wiringpi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/) library.
After that you can compile the examples by executing *make*. 

## Note
The 'RF\_Sniffer' code is as yet untested.  It _should_ work, but it is still being tested thoroughly.  It's provided to allow you to start playing with it now.
